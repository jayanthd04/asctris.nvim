## What is an Asctris? 
Asctris is a port of the popular arcade game Tetris that is rendered purely using ASCII characters hence its name. Though functionally Asctris is very similar to Tetris, it does share some minor quirks such as the fact that there is no leveling mechanic that makes the blocks fall faster as the game progresses, and unlike its predecessor, once a block has been locked in, it cannot be moved.
